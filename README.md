# Real_time_MTCNN_face_detection
There are various ways to implement each of the steps in a face recognition pipeline. In this post weâ€™ll focus on popular deep learning approaches where we perform face detection using MTCNN, feature extraction using FaceNet and classification using Softmax.
This is a testing file for mtcnn built-in model in images and real-time.

## MTCNN
MTCNN or Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks is a neural network which detects faces and facial landmarks on images.
